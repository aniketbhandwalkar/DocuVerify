# UIDAI Certificate Information

This folder should contain the UIDAI public certificate for Secure QR signature verification.

## How to Obtain the Certificate

1. Visit the official UIDAI website: https://uidai.gov.in
2. Navigate to the "Offline Verification" or "Developer" section
3. Download the public certificate for QR code verification
4. Save it as `uidai_cert.pem` in this folder

## Certificate Purpose

The certificate is used to verify the RSA-2048 digital signature embedded in Aadhaar Secure QR codes.
This cryptographic verification proves that the QR data was generated by UIDAI and has not been tampered with.

## For Academic/Testing Purposes

When the real certificate is not available, the system will use a demo key for demonstration purposes.
The demo key CANNOT verify real Aadhaar QR signatures and should only be used for testing the system flow.

## Important Note

The UIDAI certificate is public and freely available. Using it does not require any special permissions
as it only contains the public key needed for verification.
